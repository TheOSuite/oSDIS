# Software and Data Integrity Scanner

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.13-blue)

This script is a Python-based tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It's designed to help identify potential Software and Data Integrity Failures (aligned with OWASP Top 10 2021 A08) by performing a one-time audit of a target website.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for educational and auditing purposes only. **Only scan websites that you have explicit permission to test.** Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical. This tool identifies *potential* indicators and does not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.

## Features

*   **GUI Interface:** Easy-to-use graphical interface built with Tkinter.
*   **Website Scanning:** Fetches and analyzes the HTML content and HTTP headers of a target URL.
*   **HTTP Security Header Analysis:** Checks for the presence and configuration of common security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
*   **Script Integrity Checks:** Analyzes external `<script>` tags for the presence of Subresource Integrity (SRI) attributes and checks for potentially significant inline scripts.
*   **Software Update Integrity Indicators:** Identifies potential links to software update files and looks for associated checksum or signature links. Also checks for insecure HTTP update links and common update-related URL patterns.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Analysis:** Parses and analyzes the `Content-Security-Policy` header for risky directives (`unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval`, `*`) and missing important directives.
*   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) Analysis:** Checks both external scripts and stylesheets (`<link rel="stylesheet">`) for the presence of the `integrity` attribute.
*   **Potential Deserialization Indicators:** Looks for potential indicators of insecure deserialization by analyzing `Content-Type` headers, cookies, and URL parameters for patterns like base64 encoding. **Note: This is a heuristic check and may produce false positives.**
*   **Severity Coloring:** Displays findings in the GUI with color coding based on severity (High, Medium, Low, Info).
*   **HTML Report Generation:** Saves the scan results as a formatted HTML report.
*   **Timeout Configuration:** Allows setting a timeout for HTTP requests.
*   **Proxy Support:** Supports configuring an HTTP/HTTPS proxy for scanning.
*   **Threading:** Performs the scan in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive.
*   **Progress Indicator:** Shows the progress of the scan in the GUI.

## Installation

1.  **Install Python:** If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Ensure you add Python to your system's PATH during installation.
2.  **Install Required Libraries:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

    Tkinter and `hashlib`, `datetime`, `base64`, `threading`, and `urllib.parse` are usually included with standard Python installations.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the Script:** Save the provided Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `sdis.py`).
2.  **Run the Script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run:

    ```bash
    python oSDIS.py
    ```
3.  **Enter Target URL:** In the GUI, enter the full URL of the website you want to scan (e.g., `https://example.com`).
4.  **Configure Options (Optional):**
    *   **Timeout:** Adjust the timeout value in seconds for HTTP requests.
    *   **Proxy:** Enter the proxy address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`) if you want to use a proxy.
5.  **Start Scan:** Click the "Scan" button.
6.  **View Results:** The scan results will appear in the text area, color-coded by severity.
7.  **Save Report:** Click the "Save Report (HTML)" button to save the findings as an HTML file.

## Understanding the Results

The results area and the HTML report will display findings categorized by the type of check performed. Each finding includes:

*   **Severity:** Indicates the potential impact (High, Medium, Low, Info).
*   **Issue:** A description of the potential vulnerability or misconfiguration.
*   **Details (often):** Specific information like the problematic header value, URL, or script source.

**Important Notes on Findings:**

*   **Potential Deserialization Indicators:** Findings in this category are based on heuristics (like base64 encoding) and are **not definitive proof** of a deserialization vulnerability. They indicate areas that warrant manual investigation.
*   **External Audit Limitations:** This tool performs an external audit. It cannot see the internal workings of the application or the CI/CD pipeline. Findings are based on observable information.
*   **Severity Levels:** Severity levels are assigned based on the potential risk of the identified issue from an external perspective. They may differ from internal risk assessments.
